"""Tests for the dev-only account switcher.

The conftest sets up the app with whatever ENABLE_DEMO_SEED is in the
container env. In docker compose dev, that's "1", so the blueprint is
registered. We assert two contracts:

  1. The endpoint is gated by an email allowlist — even when registered,
     it must refuse arbitrary emails (audit defence in depth).
  2. The endpoint requires POST + CSRF (handled at the framework level).
