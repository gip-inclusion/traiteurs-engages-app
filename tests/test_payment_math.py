"""Audit finding #7: the Payment ledger math must reflect the actual
Stripe transfer.

Stripe invoice total = quote_total_ttc + fee_ttc (the platform fee is
added on top as an extra invoice line). `application_fee_amount` is
taken from that total, so the transfer to the caterer equals
    invoice_total - application_fee  =  quote_total_ttc.

Before the fix, `amount_to_caterer_cents` was recorded as
    total_ttc_cents - platform_fee_ttc_cents
which double-deducts the fee and makes the ledger understate caterer
payouts by fee_ttc.
