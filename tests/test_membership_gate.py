"""Audit finding #4: pending-membership client_users must not access
role-protected pages until an admin approves them.

Background:
    auth.py signup: when a user signs up with the SIRET of an existing
    company, a `client_user` is created with membership_status=pending.
    No session is issued at signup time, and /login refuses pending
    users upfront. Defense in depth: app.py.load_current_user wipes
    g.current_user for any session pointing at a pending/rejected user
    so a stale cookie can't bypass the login check.

    Without this gate, a pending user could read /client/dashboard,
    /client/orders, /client/messages, etc — leaking the company's
    quote requests, orders, internal DMs and budget figures to anyone
    who can sign up with the company's (public) SIRET.
